Large Changes:
  - redux-saga
    - definitions are customized to match the flow definitions we were using
    - Saga<> has been replaced with SagaGenerator<>
      - Saga typically indicates a function that returns a Generator, I've created SagaGenerator to clarify this distinction
  - reselect
    - definitions are completely custom and ioncompatible with upstream definitions :/
    - variadic selector definitions are a little wonky but are discouraged anyways.
  - react
    - `props: Props` should not be declared in Class-Components. this is not valid
    - StatelessFunctionalComponent does not exist. it is now FC or FunctionComponent
  - `global` has been replaced with `globalThis`. accessing non-standard properties on global will fail
    - this does no apply to `window` which is typed as `Window & GlobalThis`

conversion process:
 - cherry pick typescript configuration
 - cherry-pick manually converted commits (these end at ts/config which can be rebased)
 - run codemod (scripts/convert.sh)
 - split conversion into migration and rename commits
   - process for doing this is kinda hard. see scripts/branchify.sh for the process
 - cherry-pick manual fixes
 - run yarn lint:fix
 - cherry-pick lint fixes
   - manual lint fixes
   - auto-suppress remaining lint issues
   - reflow eslint-disable-line comments because prettier will screw them up(see scripts/fixEslintComments.js)
 - cherry-pick type fixes
 - cherry-pick pre-prettier fixes
 - cherry-pick pre-typescript-autosuppress issues
 - yarn prettier:fix
 - run TS autosuppress(scripts/autosuppress.sh)
 - yarn prettier:fix again(because TS autosuppress will add some bad formatting)

dev environment changes:
 - writing typed-code
   - typescript does not have a concept of "inexact" objects. all objects are exact. the syntax {|...|} is not valid
   - we have enums now!
     - prefer using `enum` over `const enum`. const enums are not usable outside of the file they were declared in
   - casts are done with the `as <Type>` syntax. flow-style type-casts(`(<var>: <type>)`) are not valid
   - when declaring object or tuple literals, prefer using `as const` to increase specificity of the declared data
   - the `{[key: <type>]: <type>}` is mostly served by `Record<key, value>` but some cirumstances require `Partial<Record<key, value>>` to indicate when the resulting value is epxected to exist based on the type/value of the key. we could enable noUncheckedIndexAccess to catch this in the future
   - typescript Generics are far far better than
 - development
   - a separate flow-extension is no longer required, TS support is built into vscode
   - types for packages can be installed from `@types/`. Community-maintained type packages comes from the (DefinitelyTyped Project)[https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped]
   - `yarn flow` and `yarn flow:*` are now deprecated, use `yarn tsc` instead.
